**Junior software developer**

I have a growth mindset and am always seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and abilities. Taking on new challenges and learning new things is something I enjoy, as it allows me to continually develop my skills and reach new levels of proficiency. <br />
I prefer to break down large problems into smaller, more manageable pieces. This allows me to focus on solving the easier parts first, and then work my way towards a solution step by step.<br />
