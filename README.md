## Valeria Serci

Junior software developer 

What I love about coding is that, like a puzzle, it allows me to use my brain to find solutions to complex problems.

## Skills

I am very patient and love solving problems; attention to details, challenge myself with new things. 
I usually take a big problem and split it in small pieces, so I can solve the easiest parts first and step by step solve everything. 
I spend the necessary time to double check my work to find typos and bugs.
I always try to find new things to learn and challenges to test my skills.
I speak italian fluently.
