# Valeria Serci

**Junior software developer**

One thing I love about coding is that, like a puzzle, it allows me to use my brain to find solutions to complex problems.

# Skills

I am very patient and love solving problems. I pay attention to details and challenge myself with new things.<br />
When tackling a big problem, I usually break it down into smaller pieces, so I can solve the easiest parts first and then work step by step to solve everything.<br />
I take the necessary time to double-check my work to find typos and bugs. I am always eager to learn new things and take on new challenges to test my skills.<br />
Additionally, I am fluent in Italian.
