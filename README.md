With a background in hospitality and childcare, my journey into coding started as a curiosity nurtured by friends and family.</br>
I am constantly seeking new opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills.</br>
For the past 5 years, I've attended technical courses and immersive experiences like **Makers Academy** coding bootcamp and **Chingu Voyage 46** program.</br>
I am currently implementing a fully deployed full-stack app called **Craft-Purse**.

**Currently Learning and practising:** Python, Scala, Kotlin.</br>
**Interesting facts about my learning:** I have over 570 honor on Codewars, my profile [here](https://www.codewars.com/users/ValeSer) and I love receiving feedback!
