## Valeria Serci

Junior software developer 

What I love about coding is that, like a puzzle, it allows me to use my brain to find solutions to complex problems.

## Skills

I am very patient and love solving problems; attention to details, challenge myself with new things. 
I usually take a big problem and split it in small pieces, so I can solve the easiest parts first and step by step solve everything. 
I spend the necessary time to double check my work to find typos and bugs.
I always try to find new things to learn and challenges to test my skills.
I speak italian fluently.

## Experience

**Private Family** (April 2018 to April 2019)    
*Nanny*
I solved problems when the kids were tired and they didn't want to listen; managed my time and used organizing skills when I organized playdates and had all my tasks completed everyday at the end of the day. I used my creativity making up games for them.

**Caffe' Nero** (September 2016 to February 2017)   
*Barista*  
Team work was crucial: we planned our tasks as a team everyday, I applied also my empathy with customers, meeting they need even when their requests were difficult to accomplish. I solved some problems due to customer complains. Communication was in place encouraging honesty and transparency.
